              <p className="text-gray-700">
                I believe that effective SEO isn't just about following technical guidelinesâ€”it's about creating value for users. My approach focuses on understanding the unique needs of each business and their target audience, then developing strategies that align with both business goals and search engine requirements.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
                Instead of chasing algorithms, I focus on sustainable practices that build long-term search visibility. This means prioritizing user experience, creating genuinely helpful content, and implementing technical best practices that help both users and search engines access and understand your website.
